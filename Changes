- Merge 2.0.22:
  + Show session open time in "show session"/"show user" detailed output.
  + Have slaves with BGP configured drop BGP on receipt of a shutdown
    signal, but hang about for an additional 5s to process any remaining
    traffic.
  + Run regular_cleanups after processing the results of the select,
    looking at a sufficient slice of each table to ensure that all
    entries are examined at least once per second.
- Merge 2.0.21:
  + Cluster changes from Michael, intended to prevent a stray master
    from trashing a cluster:
    = Ignore heartbeats from peers claiming to be the master before the
      timeout on the old master has expired.
    = A master receiving a stray heartbeat sends a unicast HB back, which
      should cause the rogue to die due to the tie-breaker code.
    = Keep probing the master for late heartbeats.
    = Drop BGP as soon as we become master with the minumum required peers.
    = Any PING seen from a master forces an election (rather than just
      where basetime is zero).
    = A slave which receives a LASTSEEN message (presumably a restarted
      master) sends back new message type, C_MASTER which indicates the
      address of the current master.
  + New config option: cluster_master_min_adv which determines the minimum
    number of up to date slaves required before the master will drop
    routes.
- Merge 2.0.20:
  + Add handling of "throttle=N" RADIUS attributes.
  + Fix RADIUS indexing (should have 16K entries with 64 sockets).
- Merge 2.0.19:
  + Fix leak in session freelist when initial RADIUS session allocation
    fails.
- Merge 2.0.18:
  + Add a Cisco-Avpair with intercept details to RADIUS Start/Stop
    records.
- Merge 2.0.17:
  + Only send RADIUS stop record in sessionshutdown when there's an ip address.
  + Reset .die on master takeover (so that dying sessions don't have to
    hang around until the new master has the same uptime as the old one).
  + Update .last_packet in cluster_handle_bytes only when there have
    been bytes received from the modem (dead sessions were having the
    idle timeout reset by stray packets).
- Merge 2.0.16:
  + Ensure that sessionkill is not called on an unopened session (borks
    the freelist).
  + Bump MAXSESSION to 60K.
  + Fix off-by-one errors in session/tunnel initialisation and
    sessiont <-> sessionidt functions.
  + Use session[s].opened consistently when checking for in-use sessions
    (rather than session[s].tunnel).
  + Use <= cluster_highest_sessionid rather than < MAXSESSION in a
    couple of loops.
  + Don't kill a whole tunnel if we're out of sessions.
  + Change session[s].ip to 0 if set from RADIUS to 255.255.255.254;
    avoids the possibility that it will be interpreted as a valid IP
    address.
  + Avoid a possible buffer overflow in processpap.
  + Kill session if authentication was rejected.
- Merge 2.0.15:
  + More DoS prevention:  add packet_limit option to apply a hard limit
    to downstream packets per session.
  + Fix "clear counters".
  + Log "Accepted connection to CLI" at 4 when connection is from localhost
    to reduce noise in logs.
  + Show time since last counter reset in "show counters".
- Merge 2.0.14:
  + Throttle outgoing LASTSEEN packets to at most one per second for a
    given seq#.

* Fri Dec 17 2004 Brendan O'Dea <bod@optusnet.com.au> 2.0.13
