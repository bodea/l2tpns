  flag changes to be made by the parent.
- Split out master parts from cluster_check_master() into cluster_check_slaves().

- Fix radius session leak on IPCP timeout.
- Fix some off-by-one errors in tunnel/session loops.
- Add "limp along" fix for when a slave drops temporarily from the mcast group.

- Add "show version" command.
- Fix uptime counter display.
- Fix nasty bug where cluster basetime can be set to 0 when sending initial
  heartbeat.
- Don't rmmod ip_conntrack, as this can take a lot of time.
- Re-order logging in routeset such that the action is given before any error.
- Use the correct gateway address when deleting routes.

* Wed Jun 23 2004 David Parrish <david@dparrish.com> 2.0.0
- Major release
- Completely replace active/standby clustering with a new peer-to-peer
  clustering method which allows much greater throughput and is a lot more fault
  tolerant
- Add internal tbf implementation for throttling without relying on tc and
  kernel HTB
- Add support for iBGP and eBGP to advertise routes
- Add cli commands "show cluster", "show bgp", "show ipcache", "show throttle",
  "show tbf", "suspend bgp", "restart bgp", "show user"
- Interception destination must be set per-user
- If SMP machine, allow use of SCHED_FIFO, which should improve performance
- Added config option to send GARP at startup
- Added plugin_become_master and plugin_new_session_master plugin hooks
- Remove useless sessionsendarp(). This isn't needed now that we are using TUN
  instead of TAP.
- ICMP rate limiting so not every unreachable packet is replied with an ICMP
  unreachable message
- mangle table is not required on anything but the cluster master, so slaves
  will drop the mangle table and attempt to unload the ip_conntrack module
- Statically assigned IP addresses (by Radius) work now
- Add -d command-line flag to detach and become a daemon
- Configuration file is now "/etc/l2tpns/startup-config"
- Reduced MIN_IP_SIZE to 0x19 to stop a pile of Short IP warnings
- Resend initial IPCP request until it's acknowleged by the client
- Better radius session cleanup logic
- Many miscellaenous bugfixes and performance enhancements
- Thanks to Michael O'Reilly and Brendan O'Dea for most of these new features
